Todo's for my thesis
===============================

# Title - A bioinformatics tool to identify network biomarkers in cancer

# Thesis todo's in general - DON'T REMOVE
1. Single gene prioritization or driver gene methods
    - Particularly network based ones
2. Network biology in medicine and the application of network clustering or
  network community algorithms
3. Current state-of-the-art with respect to biomarker identification in cancer
    - Familiarize as to what a biomarker is and the current drawbacks
4. Cytoscape!
    - Write about point 1 and 2 above in relation to Cytoscape
    - Advantages and disadvantages
    - Benefit of integrating both of point 1 and 2 above in a unified framework
5. Select the optimal molecular network databases to be employed by the tool
    - STRING, GeneMania, iRef Index etc.
6. Code and develop the Cytoscape app
    - Transform input large gene list into a network format based on the choice
      of activity 5 above
    - Clusters the network based on the optimal methods based on activity 2
      above
    - Rank prioritize the network clusters (or potentional network biomarksers)
      based on the optimal method(s) from activity 1 above
7. With the help and collaboration with the prostate cancer Movember project, to
   assess the ability of the tool to identify potential network biomarkers in
   prostate cancer
