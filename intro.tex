\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Oversight}
To this day we still struggle with cancer. Even with all our modern equipment
and knowledge we have still not been able to tame this horrible disease. This
thesis is about implementing and using a tool named Ranklust. It is not a
standalone tool, but rather a contribution to a Cytoscape plugin named
clusterMaker2\cite{cm2}\cite{cm2-github}. The goal of this tool is to rank
clusters created from Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks in Cytoscape.
The ranks will be based on different node and edge attributes in the network.
The resulting ranks will also indicate which clusters can be seen as cluster
biomarkers, and which genes could be considered to be single gene candidate
biomarkers.
