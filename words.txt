Data communication between the Neo4J database server and the CytoScape instance
is done through the CyNeo4J app to CytoScape \cite{cyneo4j}. CyNeo4J is a
CytoScape app that was developed during the Goole Summer Code 2014 arrangement.
It supports connecting to a Neo4J instance, as well as syncing data up and down,
from and to the database server. One thing it did not support was authentication
on Neo4J servers. Not having authentication is a serious problem, so I
implemented a simple way of getting access to the database server by providing a
possibility to insert username and password at the same time the user has to
provide a URL to the Neo4J database server instance.
