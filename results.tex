\end{table}
The modularity of the clustered networks gives an indicator of how well the
process of creating the clusters went. Modularity is given as a score from 0 to
1. A score closer to 1 is more preferrable, as this indicates that the clusters
created have a good degree of separation to the other clusters in the network.
The preferred score to end up with would be around 0.8, but in this network
there has been a good amount of perturbation through the protein-to-gene
process. Modularity is not the only indicator of how well a network was
clustered, hence the choice of not setting the inflation value in \gls{mcl} to
1.6, but rather 1.8. When a lower inflation value is set, \gls{mcl} does not
separate edges between nodes as vigorously and as a direct cause, inflation will
go up. Taking the other attributes in the table \ref{tab:mcl-inflation} into
consideration, 1.8 seemed like the best inflation value. An inflation value of
1.8 has also been proved to be good for large high-throughput constructed
protein-protein networks with a large amount of alterations\cite{mcl-inflation}.

\section{Cross-validation}
Executing a cross-validation on the iRefWeb with PRWP and MAA rankings had two
purposes. The first being to prove the fact that every gene that had its prior
score removed by the cross-validation, should be found in the results of the
cluster ranking and identified as candidate biomarkers. 

The second purpose was to analyze the distribution of the genes with prior
scores removed by the cross-validation in terms of how they placed in the
cluster ranking. The analysis of this distribution was done by dividing the
amount of genes removed by cross-validation in a cluster by the total amount of
genes in the same cluster. This operation was repeated for every cluster in the
ranking, resulting in a distribution of the average amount of genes removed by
cross-validation, that was detected by Ranklust together with post-processing of
data, as cancer candidate biomarkers. A distinct descending distribution from
high to low ranked clusters would indicate that most of the genes, with a prior
score of their relevance to prostate cancer, was ranked in a way that achieved
the goal of Ranklust; ranking clusters in biological network according to
network structure and prior knowledge of relevance to diseases.

\subsection{Cross-validation in PRWP}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{cv_dist_total_filtered_prwp}
    \caption{Cross-validation distribution in clusters (PRWP)}
\end{figure}
This plot is developed from the 10 random cross-validation runs ranked with
PRWP. The results from this cross-validation shows that the higher the rank of
the cluster, the more candidate cancer genes the cluster had.

\subsection{Cross-validation in MAA}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \label{fig:irefweb-maa}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{cv_dist_total_filtered_maa}
    \caption{Cross-validation distribution in clusters (MAA)}
\end{figure}
This plot is developed from the 10 random cross-validatioon runs ranked with
MAA.  The results from this cross-validation shows that the higher the rank of
the cluster, the more candidate cancer genes the cluster had.

\subsection{PRWP versus MAA}
The values in \gls{prwp} have a tighter coupling, in other words, the distance
the coordinates have in the scatter plot deviate less from the fit than the ones
in the \gls{maa} plot. The difference is not huge as the coefficient of
determination indicates, 0.336 in \gls{prwp} against 0.332 in \gls{maa}. Both
ranking algorithms achieves a descending distribution of cross-validated genes
from the topmost to the lowest ranked cluster. But when comparing the
cross-validation results between \gls{prwp} and \gls{maa}, \gls{prwp} comes out
ahead by a margin in \gls{rsquared} value.
