\chapter*{Abstract}
Prostate-specific antigen is a prostate cancer biomarker used for screening that
in a great number of cases has led to overtreatment. The main flaw with this
biomarker is that mutation or abnormality of a single gene is seldom the single
cause of a disease. Rather, it is the process of interactions between several
components in a complex network. Next-generation technologies provide
bioinformaticians with data on a scale worthy of adding a new label to the
biomedicine industry as a whole, namely Big Data. With enormous amounts of data
comes a great challenge as how to work with it. Algorithmic approaches benefit
greatly from a bigger size in the amount of data to work with and has already
shown to take great advantage of the data that comes from high-throuput
technologies. One of the advantages is the potential to identify and prioritize
genes that promote diseases by analyzing biologically related networks. Another
advantage is the newly gained understanding of the topological organization of
large-scale molecular networks, which has been achieved through clustering
networks and creating modules.

The goal of this assignment was to combine these two
newly adapted methods in bioinformatics to develop a tool in Cytoscape, in order
to identify and prioritize network biomarkers for prostate cancer. Through
cross-validation, benchmarking against text mined, manually knowledge curated
and experimental data, Ranklust has demonstrated this ability by using the
PageRank with Priors algorithm to rank clusters made with the Markov Cluster
algorithm on a protein-protein network (PPI).
